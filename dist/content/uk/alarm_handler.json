{"summary":"An Alarm Handling Process","description":"<p> </p><p>The alarm handler process is a <span class=\"bold_code bc-18\"><a href=\"/docs/gen_event\"><span class=\"code\">gen_event</span></a></span> event manager process that receives alarms in the system. This process is not intended to be a complete alarm handler. It defines a place to which alarms can be sent. One simple event handler is installed in the alarm handler at startup, but users are encouraged to write and install their own handlers.</p> <p>The simple event handler sends all alarms as info reports to the error logger, and saves all in a list. This list can be passed to a user-defined event handler, which can be installed later. The list can grow large if many alarms are generated. This is a good reason to install a better user-defined handler.</p> <p>Functions are provided to set and clear alarms. The alarm format is defined by the user. For example, an event handler for SNMP can be defined, together with an alarm Management Information Base (MIB).</p> <p>The alarm handler is part of the SASL application.</p> <p>When writing new event handlers for the alarm handler, the following events must be handled:</p> <dl> <dt><strong><span class=\"code\">{set_alarm, {AlarmId, AlarmDescr}}</span></strong></dt> <dd> <p>This event is generated by <span class=\"code\">alarm_handler:set_alarm({AlarmId, AlarmDecsr})</span>.</p> </dd> <dt><strong><span class=\"code\">{clear_alarm, AlarmId}</span></strong></dt> <dd> <p>This event is generated by <span class=\"code\">alarm_handler:clear_alarm(AlarmId)</span>.</p> </dd> </dl> <p>The default simple handler is called <span class=\"code\">alarm_handler</span> and it can be exchanged by calling <span class=\"bold_code bc-13\"><a href=\"/docs/gen_event#swap_handler-3\"><span class=\"code\">gen_event:swap_handler/3</span></a></span> as <span class=\"code\">gen_event:swap_handler(alarm_handler, {alarm_handler, swap}, {NewHandler, Args})</span>. <span class=\"code\">NewHandler:init({Args, {alarm_handler, Alarms}})</span> is called.
