{"summary":"Perl-like regular expressions for Erlang.","description":"<p> </p><p>This module contains regular expression matching functions for strings and binaries.</p> <p>The <span class=\"bold_code bc-17\"><a href=\"/erldoc/docs/#regexp_syntax\">regular expression</a></span> syntax and semantics resemble that of Perl.</p> <p>The matching algorithms of the library are based on the PCRE library, but not all of the PCRE library is interfaced and some parts of the library go beyond what PCRE offers. Currently PCRE version 8.40 (release date 2017-01-11) is used. The sections of the PCRE documentation that are relevant to this module are included here.</p> <div class=\"note\"><div class=\"label\">Note</div><div class=\"content\"><p> </p><p>The Erlang literal syntax for strings uses the &quot;\\&quot; (backslash) character as an escape code. You need to escape backslashes in literal strings, both in your code and in the shell, with an extra backslash, that is, &quot;\\\\&quot;.</p> <p></p></div></div> <p></p>"}
