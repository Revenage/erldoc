{"summary":"","description":"<p> </p><p>On Windows, the preferred way to start the Erlang system for interactive use is as follows:</p> <p><span class=\"code\">werl &lt;arguments&gt;</span></p> <p>This starts Erlang in its own window, with fully functioning command-line editing and scrollbars. All flags except <span class=\"code\">-oldshell</span> work as they do for <span class=\"bold_code bc-19\"><a href=\"/erldoc/docs/erl\"><span class=\"code\">erl(1)</span></a></span>.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To copy text to the clipboard, use <span class=\"code\">Ctrl-C</span>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To paste text, use <span class=\"code\">Ctrl-V</span>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To interrupt the runtime system or the shell process (depending on what has been specified with system flag <span class=\"code\">+B</span>), use <span class=\"code\">Ctrl-Break</span>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In cases where you want to redirect standard input and/or standard output or use Erlang in a pipeline, <span class=\"code\">werl</span> is not suitable, and the <span class=\"code\">erl</span> program is to be used instead.</p> <p>The <span class=\"code\">werl</span> window is in many ways modeled after the <span class=\"code\">xterm</span> window present on other platforms, as the <span class=\"code\">xterm</span> model fits well with line-oriented command-based interaction. This means that selecting text is line-oriented rather than rectangle-oriented.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To select text in the <span class=\"code\">werl</span> window, press and hold the left mouse button and drag the mouse over the text you want to select. If the selection crosses line boundaries, the selected text consists of complete lines where applicable (just like in a word processor).</p> </li> <li> <p>To select more text than fits in the window, start by selecting a small part in the beginning of the text you want, then use the scrollbar to view the end of the desired selection, point to it, and press the <strong>right</strong> mouse button. The whole area between your first selection and the point where you right-clicked is included in the selection.</p> </li> <li> <p>To copy the selected text to the clipboard, either use <span class=\"code\">Ctrl-C</span>, use the menu, or press the copy button in the toolbar.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Pasted text is inserted at the current prompt position and is interpreted by Erlang as usual keyboard input.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To retrieve previous command lines, press the <span class=\"code\">Up arrow</span> or use <span class=\"code\">Ctrl-P</span>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>A drop-down box in the toolbar contains the command history. Selecting a command in the drop-down box inserts the command at the prompt, as if you used the keyboard to retrieve the command.</p> <ul> <li> <p>To stop the Erlang emulator, close the <span class=\"code\">werl</span> window.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p>","funcs":""}
